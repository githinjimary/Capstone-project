# CAPSTONE-PROJECT
***BACKGROUND***
Most schools, especially day schools, face the challenge of students skiving lessons. Once they have been registered present in the morning, they escape school. Should anything bad happen to such a student outside school while the record states that the student was present in school, could reflect badly on the teacher. Therefore, as a day school teacher I chose this project to help reduce or manage this problem. The project involves creating a face detection APP that automatically detects students present in class and automatically records the attendance. The data is taken live by using a camera in class and can be done at any time of the day as many times as possible. 

***WORKING***
The project involves creating a GUI that detects faces of students and registers their attendance in a csv file. Students from one class will be registered in the system by scanning their faces and registers them as present or absent.This information is saved as a csv file and sent to the respective classteachers through mail,the data is then stored in a database. 
This project can later be used to scan students in an entire school and send messages to the respective class teachers and parents when their student was absent.

****FACIAL RECOGNITION****
A facial recognition system is a technology capable of matching a human face from a digital image or a video frame against a database of faces, typically employed to authenticate users through ID verification services, works by pinpointing and measuring facial features from a given image.(according to wikipedia).It is built using dlib’s state-of-the-art face recognition, built with deep learning. The model has an accuracy of 99.38% on the
Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark.
**how it works**
when one gives a picture of a user to record his/her "facial identity".
A first model will dig up whether there is a face or not and determine its location on the photo.
A second model will calculate the facial parameters. (distance between the eyes, shape of the chin,…)
Then save this "encoded" data by linking them to a name so that they can be compared with a future picture.
Then one gives a new nameless photo or live video and the same process will be repeated except that this time, a third model will compare the parameters of the face with those it already knows.

# GUI
***tkinter***
We used tkinter to deploy the project.Tkinter is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit.

A real time attendance was taken on thursday 5th of May and it worked well.

***OBJECTIVES***
    • To monitor the lesson attendance of students in class.
    • This automatically reduces the number of students skiving lessons and leaving school without permission. 
    • To enhance discipline through constant monitoring. 

***CHALLENGES***
    •Illumination: It changes the face appearance drastically, it is observed that the slight changes in lighting conditions cause a significant impact on its results.
    • Pose: Facial Recognition systems are highly sensitive to the pose, Which may result in faulty recognition or no recognition if the database is only trained on frontal face view.
    • Facial Expressions: Different expressions of the same individual are another significant factor that needs to be taken into account. Modern Recognizers can easily deal with it though.
    • Low Resolution: Training of recognizer must be done on a good resolution picture, otherwise the model will fail to extract features.
    • Aging: With increasing age, the human face features shape, lines, texture changes which are yet another challenge. 
    
 ***CONCLUSION***
Most schools use finger print to keep record of students in school.Due to covid restrictions, this is nolonger the best way to take record. Since the finger print record is taken at specific time of the day and not automatically, it does not play a very good role at monitoring students lesson attendance in school.
